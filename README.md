# Python-Task-Master
College project to count number of regular and D2D students.
Which are passed in exam without backlog and with backlog in year wise format.

### Packages Needed
* [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)

### Dataset Used
It contains each semester wise students information about student is passed or failed.
I have 6 years of records with different semester files.

Year | Semester
-----|---------
2018 | 2 
2017 | 4
2016 | 6
2015 | 8
2014 | 8
2013 | 8

Here I can't provide dataset as it containing student's personal information!
